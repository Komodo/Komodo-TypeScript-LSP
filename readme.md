# Komodo IDE JavaScript/TypeScript LSP Support

This addon for Komodo IDE adds JavaScript/TypeScript LSP support to Komodo's CodeIntel. Once installed you can switch 
to the LSP version of CodeIntel by opening a JavaScript or TypeScript file, opening the Symbol Browser and selecting the
LSP Engine from the cog menu.

For this addon to work Node.js needs to be installed on your system and Komodo should be able to find it on its PATH, or 
you can manually configure it via Preferences > Languages > Node.js.

You can also pass a custom LSP binary as well as pass custom arguments via Preferences > Code Intelligence > 
LSP: TypeScript/JavaScript.
